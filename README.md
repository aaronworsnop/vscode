# My VSCode Setup
`3+ active users ü§Ø`  
  
There's nothing too special to see here‚Äîjust my own personal mix-up of extensions, icon-packs and more intricate color-theme customisations. It's a really clean and basic foundation (mainly focused on aesthetics) that you can build on‚Äîperfect for anyone who wishes VSCode was just a *littleeee* ü§è more clean. (This is quite close to stock VSCode, because stock VSCode is honestly pretty good.)

## Notable Features
- Clean, flat and simplified aesthetic
- Enhanced version of default VSCode text Color Theme (the colour of the text you're looking at when programming)
  - More saturated colours
  - Better bracket hierarchy colours
  - Better `string` and `comment` colours (Brown or "Dark Orange" should *never* exist in a code editor ü§Æ)
- Better tab-switching (Browser/Queue-style instead of Window/Stack-style)
  - `CTRL + TAB`/`CTRL + SHIFT + TAB` moves to next/previous tab instead of most recent/least recent tab
  - For me, this finally made tab-switching in VSCode useable. 
- Right-aligned side/activity bar to prevent your code shifting when opening your File Explorer etc.
- Nicer icons
- Pretty error messages

## Setup
To configure your VSCode according to this setup...
1. Download `keybindings.json` and `settings.json` and put them where your VSCode app data is stored (on a default Windows installation this looks like `C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Roaming\Code\User`).
2. Change your theme, add more extensions and do the manual changes found below.

### Theme
This entire setup is based on the `Default Dark +` VSCode Theme. 

### Extensions
- **Material Icon Theme**
  - Toggle Folder Arrows: Off
  - Change Opacity: 0.8
- **Error Lens** (*Alexander*)
- **TODO Highlight v2** (*Jonathan Clark*)
- **vscode-pdf** (*tomoki1207*)
- **GitHub Copilot** (*GitHub*)
- **Live Preview** (*Microsoft*)

### Manual Changes
- Set the `Quick Input Position` to `Center` by navigating to `Customize Layout` in the Command Palette
- Set up a Git Blame extension (your preffered style‚Äîinline or on the status bar)

## Done!
**See, don't your colours and menus look that little bit more polished now?** üòâ
